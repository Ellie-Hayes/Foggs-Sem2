<h2>About</h2>
A small project to learn about the 3D graphics and rendering pipeline using OpenGL to create a showcase of different objects and materials that are able to be rotated with the arrow keys. Use WASD to rotate the camera, N to flip to the next object, and B to return to the previous one. 

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

To be able to load complex objects and render them to the screen. Visual Studio installation is required. 

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- Texture loading from files 
- Loading object files and using it as an objects mesh
- Initialising Lighting  
- Camera movement in a 3D space 
- Text rendering 

<h2>Installation</h2>
